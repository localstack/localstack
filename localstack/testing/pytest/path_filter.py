"""
A pytest plugin that limits test selection based on an input file.
The input file is a plaintext file with one subpath entry per line.
After gathering all potential tests, the candidates are filtered by matching with these entries.
At least one entry has to match for the test to be included in the test run.

Example usage: `pytest --path-filter=test_selection.txt`

File content of `test_selection.txt`:

```
tests/mymodule/
tests/myothermodule/test_conrete_thing.py
```

There are also special values that represent
a) SENTINEL_NO_TEST: change is not classified (=> run everything)
b) SENTINEL_ALL_TESTS: change that is explicitly classified but doesn't require running a test

If all detected changes are in category b) there will be NO tests executed (!).
If any change in category a) is detected, ALL tests will be executed.
