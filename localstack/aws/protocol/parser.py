"""
Request parsers for the different AWS service protocols.

The module contains classes that take an HTTP request to a service, and
given an operation model, parse the HTTP request according to the
specified input shape.

It can be seen as the counterpart to the ``serialize`` module in
``botocore`` (which serializes the request before sending it to this
parser). It has a lot of similarities with the ``parse`` module in
``botocore``, but serves a different purpose (parsing requests
instead of responses).

The different protocols have many similarities. The class hierarchy is
designed such that the parsers share as much logic as possible.
The class hierarchy looks as follows:
::

                          │RequestParser│

                           └─────────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
::

The ``RequestParser`` contains the logic that is used among all the
different protocols (``query``, ``json``, ``rest-json``, ``rest-xml``,
and ``ec2``).
The relation between the different protocols is described in the
``serializer``.

The classes are structured as follows:

* The ``RequestParser`` contains all the basic logic for the parsing
  which is shared among all different protocols.
* The ``BaseRestRequestParser`` contains the logic for the REST
  protocol specifics (i.e. specific HTTP metadata parsing).
* The ``BaseJSONRequestParser`` contains the logic for the JSON body
  parsing.
* The ``RestJSONRequestParser`` inherits the ReST specific logic from
  the ``BaseRestRequestParser`` and the JSON body parsing from the
  ``BaseJSONRequestParser``.
* The ``QueryRequestParser``, ``RestXMLRequestParser``, and the
  ``JSONRequestParser`` have a conventional inheritance structure.

The services and their protocols are defined by using AWS's Smithy
(a language to define services in a - somewhat - protocol-agnostic
way). The "peculiarities" in this parser code usually correspond
to certain so-called "traits" in Smithy.

The result of the parser methods are the operation model of the
service's action which the request was aiming for, as well as the
parsed parameters for the service's function invocation.

**Experimental:** The parsers in this module are still experimental.
When implementing services with these parsers, some edge cases might
not work out-of-the-box.
