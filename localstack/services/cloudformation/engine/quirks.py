"""
We can't always automatically determine which value serves as the physical resource ID.
=> This needs to be determined manually by testing against AWS (!)

There's also a reason that the mapping is located here instead of closer to the resource providers themselves.
If the resources were compliant with the generic AWS resource provider framework that AWS provides for your own resource types, we wouldn't need this.
For legacy resources (and even some of the ones where they are open-sourced), AWS still has a layer of "secret sauce" that defines what the actual physical resource ID is.
An extension schema only defines the primary identifiers but not directly the physical resource ID that is generated based on those.
Since this is therefore rather part of the cloudformation layer and *not* the resource providers responsibility, we've put the mapping closer to the cloudformation engine.
