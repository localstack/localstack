# Overview

[LocalStack 💻](https://localstack.cloud) is a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment. With LocalStack, you can run your AWS applications or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider! Whether you are testing complex CDK applications or Terraform configurations, or just beginning to learn about AWS services, LocalStack helps speed up and simplify your testing and development workflow.

LocalStack supports a growing number of AWS services, like AWS Lambda, S3, Dynamodb, Kinesis, SQS, SNS, and **many** more! The [**Pro version** of LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) supports additional APIs and advanced features. You can find a comprehensive list of supported APIs on our [☑️ Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page.

LocalStack also provides additional features to make your life as a cloud developer easier! Check out LocalStack's [Cloud Developer Tools](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/) for more information.

## Requirements

* `python` (Python 3.7 up to 3.11 supported)
* `pip` (Python package manager)
* `Docker`

## Installing

The easiest way to install LocalStack is via `pip`:

```
pip install localstack
```

**Note**: Please do **not** use `sudo` or the `root` user - LocalStack should be installed and started entirely under a local non-root user. If you have problems with permissions in macOS High Sierra, install with `pip install --user localstack`

It installs the `localstack-cli` which is used to run the Docker image that hosts the LocalStack runtime.

## Example

Start LocalStack inside a Docker container by running:

```
 % localstack start -d

     __                     _______ __             __
    / /   ____  _________ _/ / ___// /_____ ______/ /__
   / /   / __ \/ ___/ __ `/ /\__ \/ __/ __ `/ ___/ //_/
  / /___/ /_/ / /__/ /_/ / /___/ / /_/ /_/ / /__/ ,<

You can query the status of respective services on LocalStack by running:

```
% localstack status services
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Service                  ┃ Status      ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ acm                      │ ✔ available │
│ apigateway               │ ✔ available │
│ cloudformation           │ ✔ available │
│ cloudwatch               │ ✔ available │
│ config                   │ ✔ available │
│ dynamodb                 │ ✔ available │
...
```

To use SQS, a fully managed distributed message queuing service, on LocalStack, run:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
{
    "QueueUrl": "http://localhost:4566/000000000000/sample-queue"
}
```
