# Overview

[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) is a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment. With LocalStack, you can run your AWS applications or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider! Whether you are testing complex CDK applications or Terraform configurations, or just beginning to learn about AWS services, LocalStack helps speed up and simplify your testing and development workflow.

LocalStack supports a growing number of AWS services, like AWS Lambda, S3, Dynamodb, Kinesis, SQS, SNS, and many more! The [Pro version of LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) supports additional APIs and advanced features. You can find a comprehensive list of supported APIs on our [‚òëÔ∏è Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page.

LocalStack also provides additional features to make your life as a cloud developer easier! Check out LocalStack's [User Guides](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/) for more information.

## Installation

The quickest way get started with LocalStack is by using the LocalStack CLI. It enables you to start and manage the LocalStack Docker container directly through your command line. Ensure that your machine has a functional [`docker` environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed before proceeding.

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

Install the LocalStack CLI through our [official LocalStack Brew Tap](https://github.com/localstack/homebrew-tap):

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary download (MacOS, Linux, Windows)

If Brew is not installed on your machine, you can download the pre-built LocalStack CLI binary directly:

- Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the latest release for your platform.
- Extract the downloaded archive to a directory included in your `PATH` variable:
    -   For MacOS/Linux, use the command: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`

### PyPI (MacOS, Linux, Windows)

LocalStack is developed using Python. To install the LocalStack CLI using `pip`, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

The `localstack-cli` installation enables you to run the Docker image containing the LocalStack runtime. To interact with the local AWS services, you need to install the `awslocal` CLI separately. For installation guidelines, refer to the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal).

> **Important**: Do not use `sudo` or run as `root` user. LocalStack must be installed and started entirely under a local non-root user. If you have problems with permissions in macOS High Sierra, install with `pip install --user localstack`

## Quickstart

Start LocalStack inside a Docker container by running:

```bash
 % localstack start -d

     __                     _______ __             __
    / /   ____  _________ _/ / ___// /_____ ______/ /__
   / /   / __ \/ ___/ __ `/ /\__ \/ __/ __ `/ ___/ //_/
  / /___/ /_/ / /__/ /_/ / /___/ / /_/ /_/ / /__/ ,<

You can query the status of respective services on LocalStack by running:

```bash
% localstack status services

‚îÇ dynamodb                 ‚îÇ ‚úî available ‚îÇ
...
```

To use SQS, a fully managed distributed message queuing service, on LocalStack, run:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
{
    "QueueUrl": "http://sqs.us-east-1.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/000000000000/sample-queue"
}
```
