# Overview

[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) is a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment. With LocalStack, you can run your AWS applications or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider! Whether you are testing complex CDK applications or Terraform configurations, or just beginning to learn about AWS services, LocalStack helps speed up and simplify your testing and development workflow.

LocalStack supports a growing number of AWS services, like AWS Lambda, S3, Dynamodb, Kinesis, SQS, SNS, and many more! The [Pro version of LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) supports additional APIs and advanced features. You can find a comprehensive list of supported APIs on our [‚òëÔ∏è Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page.

LocalStack also provides additional features to make your life as a cloud developer easier! Check out LocalStack's [Cloud Developer Tools](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/) for more information.

## Installation
The quickest way get started with LocalStack is by using the LocalStack CLI.
It allows you to start and manage the LocalStack Docker container from your command line.
Please make sure that you have a working [`docker` environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine before moving on.

### Brew (MacOS or Linux with Homebrew)
Install the LocalStack CLI by using our [official LocalStack Brew Tap](https://github.com/localstack/homebrew-tap):
```
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary download (MacOS, Linux, Windows)
If you do not have Brew on your machine, you can directly download the pre-built LocalStack CLI binary for your system:
- Download the latest release for your platform on [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest).
- Extract the archive to a folder in your `PATH` variable:
  - MacOS / Linux: ```sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin```

### Python package (MacOS, Linux, Windows)
LocalStack is built with Python.
You can directly install the LocalStack CLI in your Python environment using `pip`.

#### Prerequisites

* `python` (Python 3.8 up to 3.11 supported)

#### Installation
```
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

This installs the `localstack-cli` which is used to run the Docker image that hosts the LocalStack runtime. The `awslocal` CLI for interacting with the local AWS services is installed separately. See the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal) for installation instructions.

> **Important**: Do not use `sudo` or run as `root` user. LocalStack must be installed and started entirely under a local non-root user. If you have problems with permissions in macOS High Sierra, install with `pip install --user localstack`

## Example

Start LocalStack inside a Docker container by running:

```
 % localstack start -d

     __                     _______ __             __
    / /   ____  _________ _/ / ___// /_____ ______/ /__
   / /   / __ \/ ___/ __ `/ /\__ \/ __/ __ `/ ___/ //_/
  / /___/ /_/ / /__/ /_/ / /___/ / /_/ /_/ / /__/ ,<
 /_____/\____/\___/\__,_/_//____/\__/\__,_/\___/_/|_|

You can query the status of respective services on LocalStack by running:

```
% localstack status services

‚îÇ dynamodb                 ‚îÇ ‚úî available ‚îÇ
...
```

To use SQS, a fully managed distributed message queuing service, on LocalStack, run:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
{
    "QueueUrl": "http://localhost:4566/000000000000/sample-queue"
}
```
