# Contributing

We welcome feedback, bug reports, and pull requests!

For pull requests, please stick to the following guidelines:

* Add tests for any new features and bug fixes. Ideally, each PR should increase the test coverage.
* Follow the existing code style. Run `make format` and `make lint` before checking in your code.
* Put a reasonable amount of comments into the code.
* Fork localstack on your GitHub user account, do your changes there and then create a PR against main localstack repository.
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests.

Please note that by contributing any code or documentation to this repository (by raising pull requests, or otherwise) you explicitly agree to the [**Contributor License Agreement**](../contributor_license_agreement/README.md).
