## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03

- Q: Contact state transitions mention automatic progression (SCHEDULED ‚Üí PASS ‚Üí COMPLETED). Should LocalStack simulate real-time state transitions based on contact start/end times, or should states remain static until explicitly queried? ‚Üí A: Active background timer updates states automatically when start/end times are reached
- Q: The spec mentions GetMinuteUsage for tracking usage metrics but doesn't define what constitutes "usage" in the emulated LocalStack environment. What should GetMinuteUsage track? ‚Üí A: Total contact duration minutes (sum of all reserved contact time windows)
- Q: When a contact is cancelled, should the cancelled contact still count toward GetMinuteUsage metrics or should only non-cancelled contacts be included in usage calculations? ‚Üí A: Include all contacts (CANCELLED contacts still count toward usage)
- Q: The spec mentions "ground station name" as a parameter when reserving contacts, but doesn't define what ground stations are available or how they're managed. Should ground stations be: ‚Üí A: Predefined static list (10-15 mock ground station names matching AWS regions)
- Q: The spec describes dataflow edges as "config ARN pairs defining data flow paths" but doesn't specify whether these pairs must be ordered or if there are restrictions on which config types can be paired together. How should dataflow edges be validated? ‚Üí A: Ordered pairs with validation (specific config type sequences required, e.g., downlink ‚Üí endpoint)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a satellite application developer, I want to create and manage AWS Ground Station resources locally in LocalStack so that I can develop, test, and debug my satellite communication applications without incurring AWS costs or requiring access to actual satellite infrastructure.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a LocalStack instance is running, **When** a developer creates an antenna downlink configuration with spectrum settings (frequency: 2.2 GHz, bandwidth: 15 MHz), **Then** the system returns a valid config ARN and the configuration can be retrieved with identical parameters

2. **Given** valid antenna configurations exist, **When** a developer creates a mission profile with minimum elevation angle (15 degrees), contact durations (pre-pass: 5 min, post-pass: 3 min), and dataflow edges linking configs, **Then** the system returns a mission profile ARN and stores all parameters correctly

3. **Given** a mission profile and satellite exist, **When** a developer reserves a contact for a specific time window (start: 2025-10-04T10:00:00Z, end: 2025-10-04T10:15:00Z), **Then** the contact is created in SCHEDULING state, transitions to SCHEDULED, and can be retrieved with DescribeContact

4. **Given** a scheduled contact exists, **When** the developer cancels the contact, **Then** the contact state transitions to CANCELLED and cannot be used for operations

5. **Given** multiple ground station resources exist across accounts/regions, **When** a developer lists resources with pagination (maxResults: 10), **Then** the system returns correct resources for the account/region with proper nextToken for pagination

6. **Given** a dataflow endpoint group with multiple endpoints exists, **When** a developer retrieves it by ID, **Then** all endpoint details (name, address with IP and port, MTU) are returned correctly

7. **Given** a configuration resource exists, **When** a developer tags it with custom tags and later retrieves tags, **Then** all tags are persisted and returned correctly

8. **Given** an invalid mission profile ARN is used, **When** reserving a contact, **Then** the system returns ResourceNotFoundException with AWS-compatible error format

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer tries to create a config with frequency outside valid band ranges (e.g., 1.5 GHz for S-band which requires 2-4 GHz)?
  ‚Üí System returns InvalidParameterException with descriptive error message

- How does the system handle contact time windows that overlap?
  ‚Üí Contacts are independent; overlapping is allowed as LocalStack emulates AWS behavior without actual scheduling conflicts

- What happens when a developer tries to delete a mission profile that's referenced by an active contact?
  ‚Üí System returns DependencyException indicating the resource is in use

- How are contacts handled when they reach their scheduled end time?
  ‚Üí Contacts automatically transition from PASS to COMPLETED state

- What happens when pagination token is invalid or expired?
  ‚Üí System returns InvalidParameterException

- How does the system handle dataflow endpoint group with no endpoints?
  ‚Üí System returns ValidationException as at least one endpoint is required

- What happens when updating a config that doesn't exist?
  ‚Üí System returns ResourceNotFoundException
