This spec preserves the SQS query protocol spec, which was part of botocore until the protocol was switched to json with `botocore==1.31.81`.
This switch removed a lot of spec data which is necessary for the proper parsing and serialization, which is why we have to preserve them on our own.

- The spec content was preserved from this state: https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/79c92132e266b15f62bc743ae0816c27d598c36e/botocore/data/sqs/2012-11-05/service-2.json
- This was the last commit before the protocol switched back (again) to json (with https://github.com/boto/botocore/commit/47a515f6727a7585487d58c069c7c0063c28899e).
