"""This Lambda Runtimes reference defines everything around Lambda runtimes to facilitate adding new runtimes."""

from localstack.aws.api.lambda_ import Runtime

# LocalStack Lambda runtimes support policy
# We support all Lambda runtimes currently actively supported at AWS.
# Further, we aim to provide best-effort support for deprecated runtimes at least until function updates are blocked,
# ideally a bit longer to help users migrate their Lambda runtimes. However, we do not actively test them anymore.

# HOWTO add a new Lambda runtime:
# 1. Update botocore and generate the Lambda API stubs using `python3 -m localstack.aws.scaffold upgrade`
# => This usually happens automatically through the Github Action "Update ASF APIs"
# 2. Add the new runtime to these variables below:
# a) `IMAGE_MAPPING`
# b) `RUNTIMES_AGGREGATED`
# c) `SNAP_START_SUPPORTED_RUNTIMES` if supported (currently only new Java runtimes)
# 3. Re-create snapshots for Lambda tests with the marker @markers.lambda_runtime_update
# => Filter the tests using pytest -m lambda_runtime_update (i.e., additional arguments in PyCharm)
# Depending on the runtime, `test_lambda_runtimes.py` might require further snapshot updates.
# 4. Add the new runtime to these variables below:
# a) `VALID_RUNTIMES` matching the order of the snapshots
# b) `VALID_LAYER_RUNTIMES` matching the order of the snapshots
# 5. Run the unit test to check the runtime setup:
# tests.unit.services.lambda_.test_api_utils.TestApiUtils.test_check_runtime
# 6. Review special tests including:
# a) [ext] tests.aws.services.lambda_.test_lambda_endpoint_injection
# 7. Before merging, run the ext integration tests to cover transparent endpoint injection testing.
# 8. Add the new runtime to the K8 image build: https://github.com/localstack/lambda-cve-mitigation
# 9. Inform the web team to update the resource browser (consider offering an endpoint in the future)
