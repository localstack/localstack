# AWS Marker Report

- Repository: {{ data.meta.repo_url }}
- Reference Commit: `{{ data.meta.commit_sha }}`
- Timestamp: `{{ data.meta.timestamp }}`

This is an autogenerated report on our pytest marker usage with a special focus on our AWS compatibility markers, i.e. the ones prefixed with `aws_`.

## Overview

```text
{% for name, count in data.aggregated.items() -%}
{{ name }} : {{ count }}
{% endfor -%}
```

Both `aws_unknown` and `aws_needs_fixing` should be reduced to `0` over time.
If you have some spare capacity please take one of these tests, try it against AWS and see if it works. Replace `aws_unknown` with the correct marker.
To avoid the case where two people are concurrently working on one test case, please tick the box to "claim" a case when you want to work on it.

_Note_: The individual assignments here are based on the entries in the [CODEOWNERS]({{ data.meta.repo_url }}/blob/{{ data.meta.commit_sha }}/CODEOWNERS) file.

## unknown ({{ data.aggregated['aws_unknown'] }})

{% for item in data.owners_aws_unknown -%}
- [ ] `{{ item.pytest_node_id }}` {{ " ".join(item.owners) }}
{% endfor %}

## needs_fixing ({{ data.aggregated['aws_needs_fixing'] }})

{% for item in data.owners_aws_needs_fixing -%}
- [ ] `{{ item.pytest_node_id }}` {{ " ".join(item.owners) }}
{% endfor %}
