# A workflow to keep up nscloud-demos with upstream.
#
# The setup is a bit funky:
#   - `upstream` branch mirrors the upstream `master`.
#   - `patches` grows from upstream and should have commits that a rebasable.
#   - `master` grows from `patches` and rewrites workflow files.
#
# Master is rewritten every time from scratch in order to avoid rebase conflicts
# in the workflow files and handle newly introduced workflows.
