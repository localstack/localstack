# (1) Lines annotated with "#extended-lib" are excluded
# from the dependencies when we build the pip package

# (2) Lines annotated with "#basic-lib" are included in the basic
# version of the pip package (i.e., for "pip install localstack").

# (3) The remaining dependencies (those without markers) are only included in
# the "full" version of the pip package (i.e., "pip install localstack[full]").
